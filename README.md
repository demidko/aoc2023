# Advent of Code 2023

The project is implemented as a set of tests. This is done for ease of development so that each task can be launched
individually from the RustRover interface.

## Usage

You need Rust installed:

```shell
cargo test --release -- --show-output
```

Please note that you may need to upload your own versions of the input files. Replace the .input files in this directory
with your own input files.
